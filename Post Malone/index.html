        <p>Austin is the fifth studio album by American musician Post Malone. It was released through Republic and Mercury Records on July 28, 2023. The bonus version of the album was released five days later to include a new track. Production was handled by Malone himself, Andrew Watt, Louis Bell, Max Martin, and Rami Yacoub. Austin was supported by four singles: "Chemical", "Mourning", "Overdrive", and "Enough Is Enough". A departure from the hip hop-driven sounds of its predecessor, it is a synth-pop, indie pop, and alternative rock album, and is Malone's first project not to feature any guest appearances.[1][2][3] Austin received generally positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number two on Billboard 200 chart, in which it earned 113,000 album-equivalent units, of which 34,000 units were pure album sales.
